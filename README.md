# NM-IBM--Project-📘 Demonstration and Documentation

🧩 Project Overview

This project is a web-based demonstration and documentation system created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to view, test, and understand how a simple JavaScript component works — combining both practical demonstration and technical documentation in one page.

The showcased example is a Counter Component, which demonstrates:

Component creation and rendering in JavaScript

Interactive functionality (increment, decrement, reset)

Display of props, usage guide, and source code side by side



---

🎯 Objectives

To demonstrate how JavaScript can dynamically create and control interactive components.

To provide clear, accessible documentation alongside a working example.

To serve as an educational mini-project showing “Demo + Docs” integration.
